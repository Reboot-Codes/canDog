# CanDog
CanDog is a CAN FD sniffer currently using the MCP2518FD.

The project is very much in its infancy, and as both @vguttmann and I have things to do, this won't progress super fast.
~~However, help is appreciated!~~

Things have changed since then, and we'll be abandoning development of this, and recommend users try [CAN Commander](https://github.com/MatthewKuKanich/CAN_Commander) instead. As of the writing up this update (May 30th 2024), no CAN FD support exists yet, but according to Matthew KuKanich, that is very much being worked on.

Currently, the number one thing that needs to be done is [libpelican](https://github.com/vguttmann/libpelican)
